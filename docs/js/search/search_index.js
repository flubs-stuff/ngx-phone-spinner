action!\nCheckout my other Ionic/Angular projects: ionic4-tooltips and ionic4-auto-complete!\nVisit my website for other cool projects!\n\nSetup\nTo install this library (component), run:\n$ npm i @flubs/ngx-phone-spinner --saveDocumentation\nAdd NumberPickerModule to AppModule\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// Import this library\nimport { NgxBadPhoneSpinnerModule } from '@flubs/ngx-phone-spinner';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n\n    // Specify this library as an import\n    NgxBadPhoneSpinnerModule,\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Once this library is imported, you can use this component in your Angular application:\nStandalone Examples\nexport class AppComponent {\n    change(value: number): void {\n        console.log(value);\n    }\n}\n\nComponent Inputs and Outputs\n\n\n\nAttribute\nType\nRequired\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnumber\n[input] string\nNo\n0000000000\ninitial value for the spinner\n\n\n(change)\n(output) number\nno\n-\nemits the value of the current number, every time the user clicks the - or + button\n\n\n\n\nIssues\nIf you find any issues feel free to open a request in the Issues tab. If I have the time I will try to solve any issues but cannot make any guarantees. Feel free to contribute yourself.\nDemo\nRun npm install to get packages required for the demo and then run ionic serve to run locally.\nThanks\n\nmandhu\njrquick17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2019 Jeremy Quick, Mamdhooh Mohamed\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
