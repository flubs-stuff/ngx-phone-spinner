ngx-bad-phone-spinner --saveDocumentation\nAdd NumberPickerModule to AppModule\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// Import this library\nimport { NgxBadPhoneSpinnerModule } from 'ngx-bad-phone-spinner';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n\n    // Specify this library as an import\n    NgxBadPhoneSpinnerModule,\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Once this library is imported, you can use this component in your Angular application:\nStandalone Examples\nexport class AppComponent {\n    change(value: number): void {\n        console.log(value);\n    }\n}\n\nComponent Inputs and Outputs\n\n\n\nAttribute\nType\nRequired\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnumber\n[input] string\nNo\n0000000000\ninitial value for the spinner\n\n\n(change)\n(output)
